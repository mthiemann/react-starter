# React Starter Project

react-starter hosts a React project that I am using to familiarize myself with React. It is based on the final product of the [React Fundamentals Course](https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals) on [Reacttraining](https://reacttraining.com) that I completed. At the moment it is still an ongoing project and I'll keep extending it.

## Extensions

The following list lists all extensions I made to the code:
- Add multiplayer
- Add Flux
